                <p>By Alessio Amorelli and Paul Humennyj</p>

                <br>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>As humans evolve and revolutionize the health industry, there are more and more ways to stay healthy and live longer lives.
                    Aside from surgical and procedural medical advancements, advancements in the medication industry have been astronomical.
                    If someone has a health problem in 2023, there is most certainly a pill that can be used to help cure said problem. Medication 
                    isn't only used for health problems, but can also be used as health promoters, such as with vitamin pills. Overall, medication 
                    has become a staple part of our society and as we grow older, it becomes more common to have to take some. However, we frequently 
                    hear or see that many elders might forget or have difficulties taking their medications. That is why we have decided to create 
                    an application that will help elders to correctly take their medication when required.
                </p>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>As humans get older, we generally get weaker both physically and mentally. It becomes more difficult to perform certain activities 
                    and we find ourselves taking more medication to help keep up with our current problems, and to stay healthy. However, it can be 
                    difficult to correctly take your medication and organize yourself with age. This is because as we age, our memory tends to become 
                    weaker and it is easier to forget things. There are also cognitive problems that could arise and can further damage our memeory 
                    capabilities. As for physical problems, our eyesight gets weaker and it becomes increasingly difficult to read small print. Both 
                    of these physical and mental problems are leading factors as to why elders have difficulty keeping track of their medication intake.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>Our team designed an application that would help users by reminding them to take their medication at the required times, as well as 
                    keep track of all the medications they have taken. This application would also be able to help them schedule their appointments and 
                    get reminders for those as well. Finally, the application would offer a feature that would allow your close ones or your caretakers 
                    to see if you have taken your medication. The application would be very simple, would display in large font to allow ease of 
                    reading, and would have a voice over option for those that have more difficulty reading.
                </p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>In order to design an app for elders, adequate research must be conducted. It is for that reason that we researched similar
                    applications, as well as created surveys and distributed them to elders to see directly what their wants and needs were.
                </p>
                <h2>A Look Into Medication Apps</h2>
                <p>There are many medication apps available for consumers and by searching through the highest rated ones, we compiled our 
                    research into different categories such as features, user's wants, and our own personal observations.
                </p>
                <p class="application-name">Medisafe Pill & Med Reminder</p>
                <p>
                    This application is primarily focused on reminding users to take their pills and medication, and to track their health. It has some 
                    useful features such as being able to see the interaction between medications (if they can clash with each other), gives reminders 
                    for refills, can track health measurements, and more. Some missing features that users have requested include an easier way 
                    to unsubscribe from emails, a better support feature that responds quickly, a way to quickly select that you have taken a 
                    medication, an easier to way to select time frames, and an easier way to "delete" a medication. Some features that we 
                    noticed that aren't available that can be helpful are being able to add reminders for other things such as retainers/night 
                    guards, exercises, etc., better functionality for one-time pill uses, and removing the subscription model for extra features 
                    as that is always a downside for an application (and this one has automatic renewals on top of it).

                <p class="application-name">MyTherapy Pill Reminder</p>
                <p>
                    This application is primarily focused on reminding users to take their medications, as well as track basic health levels. It has 
                    some useful features such as a pill tracker with a logbook for skipped and confirmed intakes, contains a health journal where 
                    users can track activities and moods, personalized tips for your treatment, and more. Some missing features that users have 
                    requested include better and more clear notifications, an option to delay medication/change time at which you will take it at, 
                    and an easy way to make one-time medication entries. Some features that we noticed that aren't available that can be helpful 
                    are a calendar system, a more in depth sharing feature, and no apopintment tracking or setting.

                    It has some useful features such as TODO
                    Some missing features that users have requested include TODO

                <p>
                    After all our research into other applications, we have come up with features we would want to include and features we want 
                    to avoid. Some of the features on the inclusion list include easy one-time medication uses, a good reminding/notification 
                    system that can be edited by the user, a calendar system with different views (day, week, month), an easier way to delete 
                    and start taking medications, and more. Some of the features on the exclusion list include subscriptions or any form of 
                    paid content, complex UI designs, small and hard to read fonts, extra health features as it can be complicated and 
                    overwhelming for users (especially elders which is our demographic), and more.
                </p>
                <h2>Surveys</h2>
                <p>We created a survey for elders and split it into two sections. The first section being their familiarity with mobile 
                    devices and the second section being focused on the user's experience with taking medication.

                <h2>Personas</h2>
                <p>After gathering and analyzing our data, we were able to generate four user personas that accurately represent our surveyed 
                    population and potential users for our application. These personas vary in attributes such as gender, age, technological 
                    knowledge, career, and personalities.

                    the path of trying to add a new medication, as well as retaking an archived medication. The bottom part shows the 
                    path of creating a new appointment, as well as editing a pre-existing one.

                <h2>Color Palette</h2>
                <p>
                    For our color palette, we wanted to choose colors that weren't too bright or dark as fluorescent colors and darker 
                    colors can make it harder to focus. We also wanted colors that popped and were appealing to the eyes, all while being 
                    lowkey and not intrusive. Our main two colors include an orange-type and a turquoise-type. We also use colors such as 
                    white and grey for soft backgrounds with black text on top as that is easier to read than white text. We also have 
                    some green and red colors to indicate certain functionalities such as accepting, rejecting, going back, etc.
                </p>
                <img src="images/colorpalette.jpg">
                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>For our typography, we wanted to focus on a font that is easily readable and is consistent when changing its size. We 
                    also wanted to make sure the font size was not only clear, but large in size (with the flexibility to switch size). Our 
                    reasoning for this is because from our research, we found that more than half of the respondents have difficulty reading 
                    smaller fonts.
                    <br><br>
                    The font we chose is <strong>Open Sans Hebrew</strong> of the Sans Serif family as it is a very simple font that

                    <sup>1</sup>. It also has a very strong boldness that catches your eye and makes it very easy to read.
