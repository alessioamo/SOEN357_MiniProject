                <p>By Alessio Amorelli and Paul Humennyj</p>

                <br>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>As humans evolve and revolutionize the health industry, there are more and more ways to stay healthy and live longer lives.
                    Aside from surgical and procedural medical advancements, advancements in the medication industry have been astronomical.
                    If someone has a health problem in 2023, there is most certainly a pill that can be used to help cure said problem. Medication 
                    isn't only used for health problems, but can also be used as health promoters, such as with vitamin pills. Overall, medication 
                    has become a staple part of our society and as we grow older, it becomes more common to have to take some. However, we frequently 
                    hear or see that many elders might forget or have difficulties taking their medications. That is why we have decided to create 
                    an application that will help elders to correctly take their medication when required.
                </p>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>As humans get older, we generally get weaker both physically and mentally. It becomes more difficult to perform certain activities 
                    and we find ourselves taking more medication to help keep up with our current problems, and to stay healthy. However, it can be 
                    difficult to correctly take your medication and organize yourself with age. This is because as we age, our memory tends to become 
                    weaker and it is easier to forget things. There are also cognitive problems that could arise and can further damage our memeory 
                    capabilities. As for physical problems, our eyesight gets weaker and it becomes increasingly difficult to read small print. Both 
                    of these physical and mental problems are leading factors as to why elders have difficulty keeping track of their medication intake.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>Our team designed an application that would help users by reminding them to take their medication at the required times, as well as 
                    keep track of all the medications they have taken. This application would also be able to help them schedule their appointments and 
                    get reminders for those as well. Finally, the application would offer a feature that would allow your close ones or your caretakers 
                    to see if you have taken your medication. The application would be very simple, would display in large font to allow ease of 
                    reading, and would have a voice over option for those that have more difficulty reading.
                </p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>In order to design an app for elders, adequate research must be conducted. It is for that reason that we researched similar
                    applications, as well as created surveys and distributed them to elders to see directly what their wants and needs were.
